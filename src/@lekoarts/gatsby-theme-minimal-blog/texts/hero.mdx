# Hey there.

If you're here to learn how to start writing tests for your WordPress themes and plugins, you're in the right place. Click on [Get Started](/get-started) up above and we'll jump right in.

If you just want some copy/paste code snippets to help you write your tests faster, browse through some of our latest posts or see them all by clicking on [Read all posts](/posts) down below.

Search functionality is coming soon, but for now we're relying on Google to help us out. If there's a specific topic you're looking for, head over to [Big G](https://google.com) and type in what you're looking for. Just make sure to type `site:https://testingforwp.com` at the end and you'll get results from just this site. Pretty cool, huh?
